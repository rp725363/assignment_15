1.How many seconds are in an hour? Use the interactive interpreter as a calculator and multiply the
number of seconds in a minute (60) by the number of minutes in an hour (also 60).
Ans:-
To calculate the number of seconds in an hour, we can multiply the number of seconds in a minute (60) by the number of minutes in an hour (60).
here below is example of multiplication:-
60 * 60
Output = 3600


2. Assign the result from the previous task (seconds in an hour) to a variable called
seconds_per_hour.
Ans:-
Here's how you can assign the result from the previous task (3600 seconds in an hour) to a variable called seconds_per_hour using Python:
seconds_per_hour=3600

3. How many seconds do you think there are in a day? Make use of the variables seconds per hour
and minutes per hour.
Ans:-
There are 24 hours in a day, so we can multiply the number of seconds per hour (3600) by 24 to get the number of seconds in a day.
Here how can we write code to calculate seconds in day:-

minutes_per_hour = 60
seconds_per_hour = 60 * minutes_per_hour
seconds_per_day = 24 * seconds_per_hour

output will be seconds in a day

4. Calculate seconds per day again, but this time save the result in a variable called seconds_per_day
Ans:-
here's how you can calculate the number of seconds in a day and save it in a variable called seconds_per_day using Python:
here are an example below to calculate seconds in a day:-
minutes_per_hour = 60
seconds_per_hour = 60 * minutes_per_hour
hours_per_day = 24
seconds_per_day = hours_per_day * seconds_per_hour
print(seconds_per_day)

5. Divide seconds_per_day by seconds_per_hour. Use floating-point (/) division.
Ans:-
Here's how you can divide seconds_per_day by seconds_per_hour using floating-point division in Python:
here is an example how to devide seconds_per_day by seconds_per_hour:-
seconds_per_day = 86400
seconds_per_hour = 3600
result=seconds_per_day / seconds_per_hour
print(result)

6. Divide seconds_per_day by seconds_per_hour, using integer (//) division. Did this number agree with the floating-point value from the previous question, 
aside from the final .0?
Ans:-
here is how you can divide seconds_per_day by seconds_per_hour using integer division in Python:

seconds_per_day = 86400
seconds_per_hour = 3600
result=seconds_per_day // seconds_per_hour
print(result)

7. Write a generator, genPrimes, that returns the sequence of prime numbers on successive calls to its next() method: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, ...
Ans:-
Here's one way to implement the genPrimes generator function in Python:
# Create a generator object
prime_gen = genPrimes()

# Print out the first 10 prime numbers
for i in range(10):
    print(next(prime_gen))
